  ![ProjectImage](pamoc_proteus.gif)

  
## 📖  Overview
 Pamoc is an Arduino Nano-based project that monitors your heart rate and suggests breathing exercises when it detects a potential panic attack. If your BPM (beats per minute) goes beyond a set threshold, Pamoc jumps into action, offering calming exercises to help you regain control.

## 🛠️ Components 

- **Arduino Nano**: The brain of the operation.
- **Pulse Sensor**: Measures the user's heart rate.
- **LCD Screen**: Displays BPM and breathing exercises.
- **Buzzer**: Provides audio alerts.
- **Battery**: Powers the system for portability.

## 🖥️ Running the Simulation 
1. Ensure you have Proteus 8 installed.
2. Open the provided .pdsprj file in Proteus.
3. Load the .hex file in the arduino nano microcontroller.
4. Press run and the simulation take action.
